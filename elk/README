Elasticsearch-- act as Log store,  is a  open source full-text search and analytics engine.

Beats: is a data shipper which collects the data at the client and ship it either to elasticsearch or logstash
[Filebeat-> to collect the logs from our containers and ship them to Logstash to be processed]
To allow Filebeat to see the logs from container in other namespaces, we must define a Service Account, a Cluster Role and then bind them together. 
DaemonSet


Logstash filters and parses the data it collects, transforming it into a common format. It then sends that data wherever you want it to go. Many organizations send the transformed data to Elasticsearch, where logs can be indexed and searched. 

Kibana is an open source data analysis and visualization tool that turns the data stored in Elasticsearch into easily consumable charts, graphs, histograms, and other visual representations.

=====================MetalLB
Kubernetes services
ClusterIP->accessible only within the cluster.
NodePort->reach the service from outside , node IP address and the port number
LoadBalancer-> pending value for the external IP address in Bare metal env.

The Kubernetes clusters deployed in cloud environments use the functionality from the provider to dynamically provision managed load balancers for the services of type LoadBalancer. 
MetalLB implements the load balancer functionality for local or bare metal Kubernetes clusters that are not deployed in cloud environments.


MetalLB has two components
Controller- allocates the IP addresses
Speaker-- Manages the advertisement of the IP address associated with them. The speaker daemon set runs a pod on every node

assign an IP to the services -> IPAddressPool CR.
Once the IPs are assigned to a service, they must be announced.[Layer 2 mode]

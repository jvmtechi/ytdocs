Kubernetes ingress demo
=======================
What is an Ingress?
Ingress is an object that allows access to your Kubernetes services from outside the Kubernetes cluster.
create collection of rules that define which inbound connections reach which services.

Ingress vs LoadBalancer vs NodePort?
NodePort and LoadBalancer let you expose a service by specifying that value in the serviceâ€™s type.
But Ingress, is a completely independent resource to your service. You declare, create and destroy it separately to your services.
- decoupled  from the services 
- consolidate routing rules into one place.

Prerequisites 
Ingress controller [NGINX  , haproxy, etc..]
Ingress resource [Ingress rules ]

will cover below routing rules demo:
Basic Routing-> exposes a single service to external traffic.
Path-Based Routing-> different URL paths within the same domain
Host-Based Routing->expose different services based on the different domains .

  
===demo
1. install  Nginx Ingress Controller
k apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.11.1/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
2.Deploy your Applications/service
3. define ingress resource rule.
4.k -n ingress-nginx get po # pick service/ingress-nginx-controller EXTERNAL-IP ->192.168.56.230
5. k -n dev get ingress # pick HOSTS- >  example.ingress
6. verify arp table entry # apt install net-tools

==
make windows host entry -- EXTERNAL-IP,  ingress HOSTS name above 
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
